## Task 1: Strategy Development and Backtesting

### Scenario: 
As a Quant Developer, you are tasked with developing multiple trading strategies (or alphas) and backtesting them on a given sample dataset. Your goal is to create a diversified portfolio that includes at least three distinct strategies, each designed to capture different market inefficiencies or opportunities.

---

### Subtasks:

#### 1. Strategy Development:
- **Task**:
  - Develop at least three different trading strategies or alphas. These could include trend-following, mean-reversion, momentum, statistical arbitrage, or any other strategy based on your expertise.
  - Ensure that each strategy has clear entry and exit rules, position sizing, and risk management parameters.

#### 2. Backtesting:
- **Task**:
  - Backtest each strategy using the provided sample dataset. Incorporate realistic assumptions such as transaction costs, slippage, and execution delays.
  - Evaluate the performance of each strategy using key metrics such as:
    - Sharpe Ratio
    - Sortino Ratio
    - Max Drawdown
    - Annualized Return
    - Cumulative Return
  - Analyze how each strategy contributes to the overall portfolio performance.

#### 3. Portfolio Analysis:
- **Task**:
  - Combine the three strategies into a single portfolio. Assess the portfolio's overall performance, including diversification benefits, correlation between strategies, and risk-adjusted returns.
  - Include a summary of trade logs, showing individual trades, entry/exit points, and trade-level performance.

---

### Deliverables:
- A Python script or Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of the strategies, backtesting code, and portfolio analysis.
- A main sheet titled "Trades" with detailed trade information, including trade entries, exits, position sizes, and P&L.
- A report summarizing the strategies, backtest results, portfolio performance, and key insights from the analysis.
- Visual aids such as equity curves, drawdown charts, and correlation matrices.

## Task 2: Feature Engineering and Machine Learning-Based Trading Strategy

#### 1. Feature Engineering:
- **Task**:
  - You are provided with a dataset containing OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for a given asset or set of assets.
  - Engineer a comprehensive set of features (N features, where more is better) that capture various aspects of the data. These could include:
    - Technical Indicators: Moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.
    - Price Action Features: High-low spreads, momentum, volatility, etc.
    - Statistical Features: Rolling means, variances, skewness, kurtosis, etc.
    - Lagged Features: Previous price, volume, and other indicators.

#### 2. Normalization and Standardization:
- **Task**:
  - Normalize and standardize the features to ensure they are on the same scale and improve model performance. This step is critical for training machine learning models.

#### 3. Machine Learning Model Development and Backtesting:
- **Task**:
  - Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks) on the engineered features to predict future price movements or generate trading signals.
  - Implement a backtesting framework to simulate trades based on the predictions and assess the performance of the strategy. Include metrics like:
    - Sharpe Ratio
    - Max Drawdown
    - Accuracy
    - Precision and Recall (if classification)
    - Cumulative Returns
  - Generate reports summarizing the model's performance and trading results.

#### 4. Validation and Out-of-Sample Testing:
- **Task**:
  - Apply the trained model to validation and out-of-sample datasets to ensure the strategy generalizes well and avoids overfitting.
  - Compare the performance on the validation and out-of-sample datasets with the results on the training set.

#### 5. Strategy Development:
- **Task**:
  - Based on the modelâ€™s predictions and backtest results, design a final trading strategy. Define clear entry/exit rules, risk management techniques, and position sizing based on the model output.

---

### Deliverables:
- Python code or Jupyter Notebook implementing the feature engineering, machine learning model, and backtesting.
- A detailed report including a summary of the features created, model performance (on training, validation, and out-of-sample datasets), and backtest results.
- A tear sheet that includes performance metrics, visualizations like equity curves, and drawdown charts.

## Task 3: Alpha Factor Function Development and Backtesting

### Objective:
To use a given set of alpha functions to develop new alpha generation strategies, backtest them on a universe of stocks, and produce a detailed performance report.

---

### Subtasks:

#### 1. Alpha Function Development:
- **Task**:
  - You are provided with a list of basic alpha functions that generate signals for trading based on certain market inefficiencies. Your task is to creatively combine, modify, or extend these functions to develop new alpha strategies.
  - Ensure each alpha function captures different market signals or inefficiencies and that they are theoretically sound (e.g., momentum, volatility, liquidity, etc.).

#### 2. Backtesting on Universe of Stocks:
- **Task**:
  - Backtest the developed alpha functions across a diverse universe of stocks. This universe may include small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap stocks across different sectors.
  - Simulate trading based on the alpha signals and evaluate performance on a stock-by-stock and portfolio level.
  - Incorporate transaction costs, slippage, and other real-world frictions to ensure realistic backtest results.

#### 3. Detailed Performance Reporting:
- **Task**:
  - For each alpha strategy, produce a detailed performance report including:
    - Total Return and Annualized Return
    - Sharpe Ratio and Sortino Ratio
    - Maximum Drawdown
    - Trade Frequency and Turnover
    - Hit Ratio (percentage of winning trades)
  - Analyze the alpha function's robustness across different time periods and market conditions, identifying strengths and weaknesses.
  - Generate tear sheets for each alpha function, including equity curves, performance breakdowns by stock/sector, and risk metrics.

---

### Deliverables:
- Python code implementing the alpha functions and backtesting across the stock universe.
- Tear sheets for each alpha strategy with detailed performance analysis, including equity curves, risk metrics, and sector-level performance.
- A report summarizing the development process of the alpha strategies, key performance insights, and potential areas for improvement.
